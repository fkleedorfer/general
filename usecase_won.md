# Use Case: Web of Needs

[Web of Needs (WoN)](https://matchat.org/) lets users post RDF structures to describe their interest in interactions. 

Independent matchers find posts (=needs) that may be suitable for an interaction and send 'hint' messages to the postings, which can be seen by the users.

Users can then start communicating by exchanging messages that can contain arbitrary RDF.

Thus, we have 4 main points where we'd like to use rdfruit:
## 1. Create Posting
Generate arbitrary RDF, ideally using the perfect user friendly GUI.

Example: I want to get from my current location to point B

## 2. Display a Posting when matched 
Render a GUI from a priori unknown RDF, ideally in a way that fits the user's context

Example: Someone is nearby and would drive me to B if I'm quick enough to hop on within 3 minutes.

## 3. Author a message 
Generate arbitrary RDF, ideally using the perfect user friendly GUI.

Example: confirm an appointment: in 3 minutes at location A

## 4. Display a message 
Render a GUI from a priori unknown RDF, ideally in a way that fits the user's context

Example: Show that the other user has confirmed my suggestion for an appointment in 3 minutes at location A
